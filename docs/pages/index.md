Signal is a simpler and more privacy-focused alternative to Google Analytics.

Collecting information on the internet is important, but it’s broken. We’ve become complacent in
trading information for free access to web services, and then complaining when those web services do
crappy things with that data.

**We need to stop giving away our data and our users' privacy for free access to a tool.**
